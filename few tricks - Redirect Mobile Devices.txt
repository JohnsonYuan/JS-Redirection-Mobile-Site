Redirect Mobile Devices


1. 
``` javascript

<script type="text/javascript">
  <!--
  if (screen.width <= 699) {
  document.location = "mobile.html";
  }
  //-->
</script>
```

"mobile.html" would be replaced with the location of wherever your mobile version resides. 
This technique could be adapted to load an alternate stylesheet as well.

2. For iPhones/iPods Specifically

``` javascript
<script language=javascript>
  <!--
  if ((navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)) || (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i))) {
     location.replace("http://url-to-send-them/iphone.html");
  }
  -->
</script>

```
